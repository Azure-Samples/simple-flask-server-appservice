# Simple Flask App on Azure App Service

This repository includes a very simple Python Flask web site, made for demonstration purposes only.

## Opening the project

This project has [Dev Container support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), so it will be be setup automatically if you open it in Github Codespaces or in local VS Code with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

If you're not using one of those options for opening the project, then you'll need to:

1. Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) and activate it.

2. Install requirements:

    ```shell
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Local development

1. Run the server:

    ```console
    python3 -m quart run --port 50505 --reload
    ```

2. Click 'http://127.0.0.1:50505' in the terminal, which should open the website in a new tab.
3. Try the index page, try '/hello?name=yourname', and try other paths.

## Deployment

This repo is set up for deployment on Azure App Service using the configuration files in the `infra` folder.

Steps for deployment:

1. Sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
2. Install the [Azure Dev CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd). (If you opened this repository in a devcontainer, that part will be done for you.)
3. Login to your Azure account:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

4. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

    It will prompt you to login and to provide a name (like "flask-app") and location (like "eastus"). Then it will provision the resources in your account and deploy the latest code.

5. When `azd` has finished deploying, you'll see an endpoint URI in the command output. Visit that URI, and you should see the front page of the app! üéâ If you see an error, open the Azure Portal from the URL in the command output, navigate to the App Service, select Logstream, and check the logs for any errors.

6. When you've made any changes to the app code, you can just run:

    ```shell
    azd deploy
    ```

### Costs

By default, this project is set up to deploy to the *free* plan of Azure App Service.
The free plan is intended for trials, experimentation, and learning the service. There is no SLA for free plan and it is metered on a per app basis. Use of free plan for production workloads is not supported.

If you would like to deploy to a paid plan, you can set the `AZURE_APP_SERVICE_SKU` environment variable to `B1` or other SKU before running `azd up`:

```shell
azd env set AZURE_APP_SERVICE_SKU B1
```

‚ö†Ô∏è To reduce unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.
